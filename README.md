## Setup (for developers)

- Navigate to the project's root folder in a terminal.
- Run `./create_venv.sh` and follow the instructions to activate the virtual environment.
  - On unix-like systems (such as OSX and Linux) this should be `source .venv/bin/activate` (for `bash` or `zsh`).
- Run `./migrate.sh` to update your database to the most recent schema.
